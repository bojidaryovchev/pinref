# Project Update Summary

## Improvements Made

### Code Architecture

1. **Centralized API Calls**: Moved all API calls to a centralized `API.ts` file with proper error handling
2. **SWR Integration**: Added custom hooks in `use-api.ts` for data fetching with automatic revalidation
3. **Schema Validation**: Implemented Zod schemas for all data types in dedicated schema files
4. **Type Safety**: Ensured strong typing throughout the application with proper interfaces and types
5. **Modernized Route Handling**: Updated all API routes to use Next.js 15's route parameters correctly
6. **Security Enhancements**: Added proper validation that resources belong to the authenticated user

### Database & Search

1. **Improved Search**:
   - Implemented n-gram based search using DynamoDB's native filtering capabilities
   - Created sophisticated token generation for both indexed content and queries
   - Added relevance scoring for better search results
2. **Database Efficiency**:
   - Used DynamoDB's `contains` operator for efficient searches
   - Implemented single-table design with GSIs for optimal querying
3. **Modular Design**:
   - Separated search utilities into dedicated modules
   - Created consistent patterns for CRUD operations across entities

### Security

1. **Encryption**:
   - Implemented proper encryption for sensitive data
   - Added decryption before sending responses to the client
2. **Authentication**:
   - Secured all API routes with NextAuth
   - Added ownership validation for all resources
3. **Input Validation**:
   - Added schema validation for all inputs using Zod
   - Implemented proper error handling for invalid inputs

### Other Enhancements

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensured proper environment variable usage
2. **UI Improvements**: Used SWR for consistent loading states and optimistic UI updates
3. **Removed Demos**: Eliminated all mock/demo data, using real API calls instead
4. **Documentation**: Updated technical documentation to reflect architectural changes

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider adding a pagination token system for very large bookmark collections
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
2. **Search Enhancements**:
   - Consider implementing stop words filtering to reduce noise in search results
   - Add stemming/lemmatization for better natural language matching
3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Add bulk operations for bookmarks
   - Implement drag-and-drop for organization
4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive test suite for all API endpoints
   - Implement E2E testing for critical user flows
