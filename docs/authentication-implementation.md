# Authentication Flow Implementation

## Changes Made:

### 1. TypeScript Configuration

- Updated `tsconfig.json` to target ES6 instead of ES2017 for better compatibility

### 2. Authentication Middleware

- Created/updated the middleware to protect all routes except auth-related ones
- Added `/auth` to the public paths list
- Changed redirect to our custom auth page instead of NextAuth's default page

### 3. Custom Auth Page

- Created a custom auth page at `/src/app/auth/page.tsx`
- Added a layout file for the auth page

### 4. NextAuth Configuration

- Updated the JWT strategy with a 30-day session
- Enhanced token handling for better security and persistence

### 5. SWR Configuration

- Reduced revalidation frequency to prevent excessive loading states
- Disabled automatic revalidation on focus
- Added deduping interval to prevent duplicate requests
- Updated the global SWR configuration

## Next Steps:

1. **Testing the Authentication Flow**:

   - Visit the app and confirm you're redirected to the auth page
   - Sign in with Google and verify you're redirected to the home page
   - Check that authenticated API requests work correctly

2. **Verify Data Loading**:

   - Confirm that SWR requests don't cause constant loading states
   - Check that data refreshes at appropriate intervals

3. **Check Permissions**:

   - Ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes
   - Verify that API routes correctly validate authentication

4. **Session Persistence**:
   - Test that sessions persist correctly across browser sessions
   - Verify that the 30-day session length is working as expected
